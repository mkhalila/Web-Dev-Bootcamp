Rendering HTML & Templates
  res.send() can take in HTML as string - but not convenient
  Use res.render() to render HTML from an EJS file
    res.render("home.ejs")
EJS
  Embedded JS
  Don't write plain HTML with express
  Looking for dynamic HMTL pages which are templates
  In directory called "views"
  npm install ejs --save
  But we don't want just STATIC sites all the time
  Some pages may be the same, e.g. homepage, login etc. But not all
  So pass variables to EJS templates

Passing variables to EJS templates
  <h1>My passed variable <%= 5 + 5 + myNumber %> </h1>
  In routes: res.render("MyFile.ejs", {myVar1: "Bananas", myVar2: 5});
    Pass parameters to MyFile.ejs encapsulated in an object
  <h1>My passed variable: <%= myVar1 %> </h1>
  Things inside <% %> can be any JS
    But there are some rules!
  Things inside <%= toPrint %> will print to the HTML whatever the JS RETURNS
  <% %> is for LOGIC

EJS Conditionals & Loops
  Logic in <% >
  E.g.
  <% for (var i = 0; i < posts.length; i++) { %>
    <% var post = posts[i]; %>
    <li>
      <%= post.title %> - <strong><%= post.author %></strong>
    </li>
  <% } %>

Including Public Assets
  E.g. Stylesheets
  Avoid repeating styles - Use external stylesheet
  Another directory for assets called public/
    public/app.css
  Tell express that assets are in public/ in app.js
    app.use (express.static ("public"));

app.set ("view engine", "ejs");
  Tell express we're using EJS
  So don't need to do render("page.ejs"),
    can do render("page")

Partials
  Dry up templates
  Templates that we can use in other templates
  So don't have to have repeated code
  E.g. Repeated code for a navigation menu
    Dont have to have it repeated, just store it as a partial
    And render the partial in all pages
  E.g. HTML boiler plate
  views/partials
  Including partials
    Change path of partials

    <% include partials/fileName %>
    /app.css

Post Requests
  In HTML, each form input to send needs to have a name
  This is what is used in the routes to retrieve the value
  Form data put in req.body
  Need to tell express to parse req.body using
    npm install body-parser --save
    var bodyParser = require ("body-parser");
    app.use (bodyParser.urlencoded ({extended: true}));

res.redirect ("/friends")
  Redirect to a path e.g. after a post
