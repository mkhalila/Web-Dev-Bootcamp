# Intro to Node

### What is Node?
A JS Runtime built on Chrome's engine
Event driven, non-blocking IO model: Lightweight + Efficient
npm - largest ecosystem of OSS libraries in the world
Enabled JS to execute on server side
  i.e. Allowed it to be written on server side, not just front end
  Can now write JS everywhere

### Why we are learning?
High demand + popularity atm
It's in JavaScript, so we already know it
  One language for frontend and backend
It doesn't matter. Need TRANSFERRABLE SKILLS
  Once you pickup Node, can easily understand the key transferrable concepts

Node console: Like Chrome console
  Useful for quick, quirky stuff
  REPL: Read Evaluate Print Loop
  Can't do things like alert(), prompt() etc
  No DOM

Running files with node
  node filename.js
  node app.js

NPM
  Largest ecosystem of OSS in world
  A package manager for JS
  Packages: Code others have written that we can include
  Centralised packages
  npm install package-name
  Installing and using packages
    npm install
    require()
      Include package in JS file
