Intro:
	Front End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Back End:
	Full Stack: Front End + Back End

Web Basics:
	Visiting a web page (Example):
		1. Computer requests copy of webpage from server of website
		2. This request is put in a Packet
		3. Packet includes information such as source, destination IP Address
		4. Packet is sent through many regional networks until it reaches the City's internet hub
		5. Destination server is identified as located in LA
		6. Packet is sent via fibre optic cables under the ocean
		7. Lands in NY Internet hub
		8. Sent via regional networks to LA server
		9. Server reads request and prepares webpage
		10. Too large to send as a single packet
		11. For internet to work efficiently, webpage is split up into thousands of packets
		12. Each wrapped with needed info
		13. Sent back to main LA/NY hub
		14. Packets sent in many different ways - doesn't matter how they get there, just that they get there asap
		15. Reaches London hub
		16. Passed through regional networks until it reaches client machine
		17. All happens in a second...

Front End:
	Stuff you see and interact with
	HTML, CSS, JS - Only
	Back end is everything else
	Front end is constructed by the Back end
	Static webpages Vs. Dynamic webpages
	Restaurant Analogy: backend is everything that happens in the kitchen, front end is what is on your plate at the table.
