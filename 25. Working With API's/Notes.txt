Two main formats WEB APIs respond with
  Not HTML - they respond with Data, not structure
  1. XML
  2. JSON

XML
  Extended Markup Language
  Syntactically similar to HTML
  Doesn't describe structure like HTML
  Encodes key-value pairs
  No particular tags like HTML
  <person>
    <age>21</age>
    <name>Travis</name>
    <city>Los Angeles</city>
  </person>

JSON
  Javascript Object Notation
  Like JS objects
  All keys and values are strings
  Become more popular than XML recently
    Since lot more applications are using JS
    Works naturally with JS
  {
    "person": {
      "age": "21",
      "name": "Travis",
      "city": "Los Angeles"
    }
  }

API Calls with Node/JS
